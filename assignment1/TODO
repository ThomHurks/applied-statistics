TODO:

critical value, doesn't a lower value mean less chance to reject the null hypothesis

add explanation why the skewness and kurtosis should be between the values that are mentioned (why these values?)

equation with label "means" heeft H0: less or equal and H1: less than, shouldn't H1 be greater than?

for the equation in section "Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test" shouldn't H1 be greater than?

Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test section should be adapted (has comment: A  WILCOXON  SIGNED  RANK  TEST  IS  UITGEVOERD  EN  NIET  EENWILCOXON RANK SUM TEST DUS DAT MOET VERANDERD WORDEN.HIER MOET OOK EEN NULL HYPOTHESE VOOR GEMAAKT WORDEN.VERANDEREN DUS!)

"grubs outlier test" section should be written

in "skewness and kurtosis" section: "The data is skewed right, which is probably the reason that the Shapiro-Wilk test rejects the assumption of a normal distribution" but shapiro wilk was not rejected

in section "Serial correlation tests with means": "This  could  indicate  that  the  silicones  have affected only one or two batches and not all batches from the point the leakage has started" this is a conclusion and should therefore be in the conclusion section
